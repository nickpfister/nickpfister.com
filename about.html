        I've enjoyed creating things since I was a kid. My first step into
        development was creating mods for the original Halo: Combat Evolved back
        when I was 10 years old. In high school, I operated Minecraft servers
        full of custom mods which held up to 30 concurrent players.
      </p>

        I studied Astrophysics at UCLA for my undergrad. But while I was doing
        that, I found the itch to build software and games kept coming back. I
        often found myself creating game design documents and learning
        programming languages in my free time. And the linear algebra I learned
        in school ended up helping me the most in adding forces in Unity instead
        of writing academic papers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after I graduated, I was accepted into the
        <a href="https://startupucla.com/accelerator/" target="_blank">
          Startup UCLA Summer Accelerator
        </a>
        with my company Planetary Gaming. This catapulted my career into a
        totally new territory where I found myself doing things I never could
        have imagined - from "speed dating" with local investors to giving
        presentations in front of 400 people to having a one-on-one meeting with
        Riot co-founder Marc Merrill.

        Though my first company was not a commercial success, it helped solidify
        my career change away from academia and into the world of software. It
        also taught me far more than just good software architecture and design
        practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, I'm looking for roles in software and/or games industries. My
        key interests include (but are not limited to):
