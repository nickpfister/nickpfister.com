        Planetary Defense was the first AR title I released, and it was highly
        experimental. That being said, I think it held up well and I personally
        enjoy going back and playing it even today. This title had several
        features which made it stand out:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The player used their phone to "aim" and position their spaceship in
          the world.
        </li>
        <li>
          Synchronous multiplayer gameplay created with Photon Unity Networking
          (PUN).
        </li>
        <li>
          Rank and powerup systems encouraged players to keep playing and beat
          their high-scores.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Planetary Defense was developed with ARCore and released as a beta on
        the Google Play Store. If you have an android phone, you can
