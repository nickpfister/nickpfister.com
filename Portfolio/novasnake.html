        NOVASNAKE remains one of my favorite achievements. It is a spin on the
        original snake/centipede games brought to life in 3D augmented reality.
        I worked on this alongside two talented interns to create a game that I,
        along with several others, just really wanted to play.

      <p>
        Though the concept of NOVASNAKE is relatively simple, there were several
        difficult problems we needed to solve in order to make a 3D AR snake
        game:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Filtering out noise/turbulence caused by player movement and
          imprecisions in AR tracking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Easing players in to the unfamiliar feeling of collecting items in AR.
        </li>
        <li>
          Collecting data on how players move in the real world while playing
          our game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Writing cross platform AR code (this was before Unity's AR
          Foundations, so everything needed to be compatible with both ARKit and
          ARCore).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There were also a few non-AR related problems which NOVASNAKE tackled:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creating online and offline modes, and merging data when players moved
          between them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Creating an interface for developers to quickly add new abilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding rewarded advertisements which could be used to unlock new
          skins.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using PlayFab to store player information and analytics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        NOVASNAKE was my first game to be released on both Android and iOS and
        make it beyond the testing phase. You can play it here:
