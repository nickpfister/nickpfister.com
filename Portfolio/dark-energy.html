          example of what my random map generation engine produces.

        Dark Energy was the first game I created with the intention of
        releasing. It's extremely nostalgic for me and represents mountains of
        learning as I transitioned from an academic programmer (creating mostly
        data analysis programs for astronomy and physics labs) to a game
        programmer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea for this came from my love of action RPGs such as
        <a href="https://www.torchlight2.com/en" target="_blank">
          Torchlight
        </a>
        and
        <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/game" target="_blank">
          Path of Exile.</a
        >
        The weapons system in Dark Energy was developed based on my infatuation
        with the weapons system in the
        <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/" target="_blank">
          Borderlands
        </a>
        series.
      </p>
      <p>
        Main features include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Randomized maze-like maps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Procedurally generated weapons.
        </li>
        <li>
          Local area gameplay using the old version (now deprecated) of UNet.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One day I hope to go back and completely revamp Dark Energy with
        everything I have learned. It was far from perfect, but it captured much
        of the burning desire I had to create games since I was in elementary
        school.
