        As a kid, I loved listening to my music on Windows Media Player.
        Particularly, I enjoyed turning on the
        <a

          href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17878/visualizations-for-windows-media-player"
        >
          visualizer
        </a>
        and watching the animations go by. Years later, I realized I don't see
        features like this on Spotify, so I went out to create my own solution.
      </p>

          3D visualizations produce a history of all frequencies over the last
          few seconds. Notice the valleys representing the tempo of the song.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I knew it was possible to retrieve
        <a

          target="_blank"
        >
          audio spectrum data in Unity</a
        >, but this requires that the music is loaded into your project. I
        wanted to visualize whatever is coming out of the sound card, so this
        was insufficient.

          This line graph responds to the peak frequencies of sound passing
          through your computer.

        After some research, I found a great open-source audio library called
        <a href="https://github.com/filoe/cscore" target="_blank">
          CSCore
        </a>
        which took care of most of my problems. I created a DLL of this library
        and adapted several of it's functions for use in Unity. Then, I created
        the graphical effects you see here. These are animated using data
        produced from a
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform"
          target="_blank"
        >

        </a>
        of the audio coming out of your sound card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this only depends on data from your sound card, it doesn't require
        songs to be loaded into Unity. You can simply stream music on Spotify
        with the visualizer open and watch what happens!

          Here I've opened an interface which allows you to tweak how the sound
          data is processed. The range of frequencies being displayed is shown
          in the bottom-left corner.
