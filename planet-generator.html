      <h1>Planet Generator</h1>

      <p>
        I aimed to solve three problems when creating my Planet Generator:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Each planet must be large enough for many players to co-exist.</li>
        <li>They should have a high level of detail.</li>
        <li>
          Artists/developers must be able to generate planets quickly with
          little knowledge of the underlying architecture.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>1. Creating large planet meshes</h2>
      <p>
        I define a large planet as being a size in which
        <em>the player can hardly tell they are on a sphere.</em> In other
        words, like being on earth, one could be convinced that they are
        standing on a flat surface. In Unity, I have found that a planet with a
        radius of 2000 units gets pretty close to this goal, assuming the player
        stands at just under 2 units tall.
      </p>
      <p>
        This would be no issue if I wanted to create a planet with little/no
        details. However, referring to point 2 above, I want my planets to be
        shaped with realistic-looking terrains. If I created one single
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh">
          mesh
        </a>
        for the entire planet, the vertex count would be so high that it would
        go above
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/65535-vertices-limit.294585/"
        >
          Unity's maximum vertex count of 65535.
        </a>
        This would also make loading and rendering a planet very cumbersome, as
        the entire object would have to be held in memory during runtime.
      </p>
      <h3>The solution</h3>
      <p>
        Before any terrain is shaped on the planets, I create a mesh in the form
        of a
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateralized_spherical_cube"
        >
          quad sphere.
        </a>
        For the interested,

          catlikecoding has a great tutorial
        </a>
        on procedurally creating a quad sphere in Unity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a quad sphere as a base mesh, the problem of size is easy to
        tackle. Instead of creating one single mesh, I generate the quad sphere
        by breaking down each side into any number of subdivisions (the larger
        the final product, the higher the subdivision count). Picture this as an
        inflated rubix cube, where each square represents one of the planet
        meshes. Example:
