        I aimed to solve three problems when creating my Planet Generator:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Planets must be large enough for many players to co-exist.</li>
        <li>Planets should have a high level of detail.</li>
        <li>
          Artists/developers must be able to generate planets quickly with
          little knowledge of the underlying architecture.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>1. Creating large planet meshes</h2>
      <p>
        I define a large planet as being a size in which
        <em>the player can hardly tell they are on a sphere.</em> In other
        words, like being on earth, one could be convinced that they are
        standing on a flat surface. In Unity, I have found that a planet with a
        radius of 2000 units gets pretty close to this goal, assuming the player
        stands at just under 2 units tall.
      </p>
      <p>
        This would be no issue if I wanted to create a planet with little/no
        details. However, referring to point 2 above, I want my planets to be
        shaped with realistic-looking terrains. If I created one single
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh">
          mesh
        </a>
        for the entire planet, the vertex count would be so high that it would
        go above
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/65535-vertices-limit.294585/"
        >
          Unity's maximum vertex count of 65535.
        </a>
        This would also make loading and rendering a planet very cumbersome, as
        the entire object would have to be held in memory during runtime.
      </p>
      <h3>The solution</h3>
      <p>
        Before any terrain is shaped on the planets, I create a mesh in the form
        of a
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateralized_spherical_cube"
        >
          quad sphere.
        </a>
        For the interested,
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/cube-sphere/"
        >
          catlikecoding has a great tutorial
        </a>
        on procedurally creating a quad sphere in Unity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a quad sphere as a base mesh, the problem of size is easy to
        tackle. Instead of creating one single mesh, I generate the quad sphere
        by breaking down each side into any number of subdivisions (the larger
        the final product, the higher the subdivision count). Picture this as an
        inflated rubix cube, where each square represents one of the planet
        meshes.
      </p>

        <img class="fill-width" src="Media/subdivided_cube_sphere.PNG" />
        <figcaption>

          subdivision is shown removed for clarity.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Not only does this solve the issue of Unity's vertex limit, it opens the
        door to several optimizations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Meshes can be loaded in chunks instead of all at once.
        </li>
        <li>
          Distant meshes can be loaded as low-poly versions to save resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meshes outside of the player's view don't need to be loaded at all.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Likewise, these optimizations can be used to create huge game worlds in
        which many players could co-exist. It could also be used to create
        extremely rich singleplayer environments.
      </p>

        <img class="fill-width" src="Media/subdivided_planet.PNG" />
        <figcaption>

      </figure>
      <h2>2. Adding detail</h2>
      <p>
        Breaking up the mesh allows for a high level of terrain detail, but what
        about textures?
      </p>
      <p>
        From my own experimentation, I found that the maximum number of textures
        Unity can process in one
        <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Pass.html" target="_blank"
          >shader pass
        </a>
        is four. You can add more by using multiple passes or adding multiple
        materials to a mesh, but this would compromise performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could just stick to the limit of four, but that is quite
        restricting. Just think about how many textures you can find if you step
        outside your house and look around. To me, this is important in creating
        an immersive experience. So after some time, I came up with a solution:
        <a
          href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-TextureArrays.html"
          target="_blank"
        >
          texture arrays.
        </a>
      </p>
      <h3>Working with texture arrays</h3>
      <p>
        I like to think about texture arrays as working with a cube instead of a
        square. With a normal texture, you can refer to a pixel on it with (x,
        y) coordinates just like you would use to refer to a point on a square.
        With a texture array you simply expand that to working with (x, y, z)
        coordinates, where the z coordinate refers to the index of which texture
        you would like to sample. This is the same way you would refer to a
        point in a cube. Using this method allows you to work with way more than
        just four textures at once, all in one shader pass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I had worked out texture arrays as the solution to my problem,
        there was just one question left: how do you pass information about
        terrain textures from a mesh to a shader?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many intricacies to this, but I will give a general outline of
        the solution. In essence, I wanted to store information about what
        textures are present in each vertex of a mesh and at what strength
        (texture strengths matter when you are blending between multiple
        textures - for example in between a beach and a field you might have 50%
        grass and 50% sand).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I had no need for the
        <a
          href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh-uv2.html"
          target="_blank"
        >
          UV2 coordinates
        </a>
        or the
        <a
          href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh-colors.html"
          target="_blank"
        >
          color coordinates</a
        >, I figured I could store the information here. So for each vertex of
        the mesh, I plug in the index of the textures present in the UV2
        coordinates (this is the "z" coordinate of the texture array which I
        mentioned above) and the strength of the texture in the corresponding
        color coordinate.
      </p>
      <figure class="centered">
        <img src="Media/UV2_color_texture_diagram.png" style="width: 60%" />
        <figcaption>
          Texture indexes and strengths are stored per vertex in the UV2 and
          color coordinates of a mesh. In this example only three textures are
          needed, so the fourth index is discarded.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        You might notice that this only allows four textures on a given vertex.
        This does not mean that a mesh is limited to four - rather we can only
        blend a total of four together on a given vertex. This is more than
        enough, as I rarely find myself blending more than three at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This solution also means that the interpolation of the UV2 coordinates
        will cause unexpected consequences (a texture with index 3 adjacent to a
        texture of index 5 will actually cause a texture of index 4 to show up
        in between). This is solved by using a
        <a
          href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-struct"
          target="_blank"
        >
          nointerpolation
        </a>
        keyword in your interpolator struct. This only works if you write your
        own vertex and fragment shaders - not a Unity surface shader.

      <h2>
        3. Adding developer tools
      </h2>
      <p>
        Making your code easy to work with is an extremely important part of
        this entire process. Like I said in the beginning, a main goal of my
        planet generator is that artists and developers should be able to
        generate planets quickly without much under-the-hood knowledge.
      </p>
      <h3>The custom editor</h3>
      <p>
        I achieved this by creating a custom editor for others (and myself) to
        use my planet generator. It contains all possible parameters that can be
        tweaked in the planet generation process, so you don't need to know how
        to code in order to use it. Here's how it looks:
      </p>
      <figure class="centered">
        <img src="Media/planet_generator_window.PNG" style="width: 70%" />
        <figcaption>The planet generator wizard.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Most of the information here is straight-forwards. The user inputs
        information about the size of the planet, how many subdivisions it has,
        etc. There is also an option to limit creation to a set number of
        meshes, which is helpful if you want to test out some settings quickly
        (huge planets with a grid size over 1024 will take a couple minutes to
        generate).
      </p>
      <p>
        The magic in this interface, however, happens in the Planet Generator
        field.
      </p>
      <h3>The planet terrain generator</h3>
      <p>
        The planet terrain generator is what takes a boring quad sphere and
        shapes its terrain using algorithms defined by the developer or artist.
        It is the main component that makes a planet look like a planet. That
        being said, it is relatively simple interface which can be easily
        extended by any developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terrain generator uses a two-pass system. The first pass goes
        through every vertex of the quad sphere (looping through every
        subdivision) and applies transformations based off of the developer's
        specifications - generally based off of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise" target="_blank">
          3D Perlin Noise</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second pass goes through all of the new vertexes and adds texture
        information to them. The second pass occurs after the vertex normals
        have been computed, as this gives the developer extra information about
        the landscape that can help influence the addition of texture. For
        example, a normal which indicates a steep angle can be textured as a
        cliff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using these two passes, terrain generators can use noise to create
        uniform biomes accross a planet.
      </p>
      <figure class="centered">
        <img src="Media/mountain_planet_generator.PNG" style="width: 70%" />
        <figcaption>A uniform mountain terrain generator.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        For a more elaborate design, you can combine multiple terrain generators
        which fade in between each other to create biomes, continents, and more.
      </p>

        generators.

        One day I hope to release this planet generator either as a developer
        tool or as a piece of a much larger game. Until then, feel free to
